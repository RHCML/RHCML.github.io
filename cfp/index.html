    We invite submissions to the Workshop on Responsible Healthcare using Machine Learning (RHCML) 2025. Each sub mission must concern responsible (fair or privacy-preserving or explainable or
    interpretable or safe) application of machine learning in healthcare.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">    
    Submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee in a single-blind manner—that is, authors must include their names in the submissions, and their identities will be visible to the reviewers. Each submission will be reviewed by at least one ML researcher and at least one healthcare researcher. Substantially different scores among reviewers may be further discussed among reviewers. 
    Final decisions will be taken by the Program Chairs based on the reviews. There will be no author/reviewer discussion phase. Only accepted papers will be publicly released, while rejected
    or withdrawn submissions will be kept confidential. 
    </p>

    <h3>Submission Types</h3>
   
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Full papers: Suitable for novel contributions. Must include results of analyses based on real-world data (preferably) or simulated quantiative data. The maximum length of papers is 16 pages (including references) in this format. </li>
    <li>Short papers: Suitable for discussing novel ideas. This can include open research challenges or practical applications to foster discussion among panelists and facilitate future collaborations. Please note that the page limit is 6 pages (including references) in this format.</li>
    <li>Extended Abstracts of already published work: Suitable for discussing previously published related work. Please mention the venue where the work was published. Please note that the page limit is 4 pages (including references) in this format.
    </ul>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
    In certain cases, authors of full submissions may be asked to revise and submit their work as a short paper.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
    Each submission should also include a section titled Generalizable Insights about Responsible Application of Machine Learning in Healthcare. For extended abstracts and abstracts of already published works, this section should provide
    a concise summary of key insights. In contrast, for full papers, a more detailed and comprehensive discussion is expected.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
    Each accepted paper must have at least one author registered for the workshop.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Submission Format</h3>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
     We suggest that submissions be in the LNCS format (<a href="https://ecmlpkdd-storage.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/2025/ECML_PKDD_2025_Author_Kit.zip">Springer LNCS Template Download</a>). Accepted papers will be included in a joint Post-Workshop proceeding published by Springer Communications in Computer
    and Information Science.
      </p>

<h3> Topics of Interest</h3>
        We invite submissions on all aspects of using machine learning for responsible healthcare. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following illustrative areas:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li><b>Fairness and Equity in ML-based Healthcare</b><br>
    Approaches to detect, mitigate, and prevent bias in ML-based healthcare models to ensure fair and equitable outcomes across diverse patient populations.
  </li>
  <li><b>Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning in Healthcare</b><br>
    Techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and secure computation to ensure data privacy while leveraging healthcare data for ML models.
  </li>
  <li><b>Explainability and Interpretability of Healthcare ML Models</b><br>
    Methods to make ML models transparent and understandable to healthcare professionals, ensuring trust, accountability, and usability in clinical decision-making.
  </li>
  <li><b>Responsible Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Healthcare</b><br>
    Exploring the potential of LLMs, such as GPT models, in healthcare applications — focusing on clinical documentation, decision support, and patient interaction — while addressing bias, privacy, and accountability.
  </li>
  <li><b>ML for Personalized Medicine and Precision Healthcare</b><br>
    Leveraging machine learning to tailor medical treatments to individual patients, considering genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, while ensuring fairness, privacy, and ethical use of patient data.
  </li>
  <li><b>Ethical and Responsible AI in Healthcare</b><br>
    Addressing the ethical implications of deploying machine learning in healthcare, focusing on patient consent, accountability, and minimizing harm.
  </li>
  <li><b>Robustness and Security of Healthcare ML Systems</b><br>
    Ensuring the security, robustness, and resilience of ML models against adversarial attacks, especially in high-risk healthcare applications.
  </li>
  <li><b>Integrating ML into Clinical Decision Support Systems</b><br>
    Best practices for integrating ML models into clinical workflows to complement healthcare professionals’ expertise and improve patient outcomes.
  </li>
  <li><b>Human-in-the-Loop Systems for ML in Healthcare</b><br>
    Exploring hybrid approaches in which human clinicians work alongside ML models to maintain ethical decision-making and improve model accuracy.
  </li>
  <li><b>Legal and Regulatory Aspects of ML in Healthcare</b><br>
    Examining the legal challenges and regulatory frameworks associated with ML in healthcare, ensuring compliance with laws such as GDPR and HIPAA.
  </li>
  <li><b>ML for Healthcare Accessibility and Policy</b><br>
    Investigating how ML can improve access to healthcare, reduce costs, and influence healthcare policy and resource allocation.
  </li>
  <li><b>Transfer Learning and Adaptation in Healthcare ML</b><br>
    Leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them for use across different healthcare domains, ensuring scalability and generalizability, while addressing ethical concerns such as fairness, privacy, explainability, and safety.
  </li>
  <li><b>Benchmarking ML-based Approaches in Responsible Healthcare</b><br>
    Developing benchmarks — including datasets, metrics, and protocols — for assessing ML-based solutions in responsible healthcare.
  </li>
</ul>
