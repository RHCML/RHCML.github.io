    We invite submissions to the Workshop on Responsible Healthcare using Machine Learning (RHCML) 2025. Each sub mission must concern responsible (fair or privacy-preserving or explainable or
    interpretable) application of machine learning in healthcare.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">    
    Submitted papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee in a single-blind mannerâ€”that is, authors must include their names in the submissions, and their identities will be visible to the reviewers. Each submission will be reviewed by at least one ML researcher and at least one healthcare researcher. Substantially different scores among reviewers may be further discussed among reviewers. 
    Final decisions will be taken by the Program Chairs based on the reviews. There will be no author/reviewer discussion phase. Only accepted papers will be publicly released, while rejected
    or withdrawn submissions will be kept confidential. 
    </p>

    <h2>Submission Types</h2>
   
    <ul>
    <li>Full papers: Suitable for novel contributions. Must include results of analyses based on real-world data (preferably) or simulated quantiative data. The maximum length of papers is 16 pages (including references) in this format. </li>
    <li>Short papers: Suitable for discussing novel ideas. This can include open research challenges or practical applications to foster discussion among panelists and facilitate future collaborations. Please note that the page limit is 6 pages (including references) in this format.</li>
    <li>Extended Abstracts of already published work: Suitable for discussing previously published related work. Please mention the venue where the work was published. Please note that the page limit is 4 pages (including references) in this format.
    </ul>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
    In certain cases, authors of full submissions may be asked to revise and submit their work as a short paper.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
    Each submission should also include a section titled Generalizable Insights about Responsible Application of Machine Learning in Healthcare. For extended abstracts and abstracts of already published works, this section should provide
    a concise summary of key insights. In contrast, for full papers, a more detailed and comprehensive discussion is expected.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
    Each accepted paper must have at least one author registered for the workshop.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Submission Format</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">  
     We suggest that submissions be in the LNCS format (<a href="https://ecmlpkdd-storage.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/2025/ECML_PKDD_2025_Author_Kit.zip">Springer LNCS Template Download</a>). Accepted papers will be included in a joint Post-Workshop proceeding published by Springer Communications in Computer
    and Information Science.
