<b>This workshop will take place at ECML PKDD 2025 in September 2025, in Porto, Portugal.</b>
</p>   

<p style="text-align: justify;">    
While Machine Learning (ML) holds considerable promise for enhancing clinical practice and patient outcomes, its deployment necessitates careful consideration of its impact on fairness, 
    privacy, and explainability to ensure that ML-supported solutions serve all stakeholders including communities, patients, clinicians, payers, and policy-makers. 
    Achieving these goals requires active engagement of all interested parties, which is challenging given differences in technical understanding of ML, healthcare goals, 
    patient behavior, and economic policy. This workshop aims to foster an interdisciplinary exchange between ML researchers and healthcare professionals, 
    addressing key methodological issues, domain-specific constraints, and best practices. Through invited talks, paper presentations, and panel discussions, 
    the workshop will contribute to advancing research on the responsible integration of ML in healthcare, promoting solutions that balance technical rigor with real-world applicability. 
    The overarching goal is to promote the development and implementation of more responsible, impactful, and safe machine learning applications in healthcare.
